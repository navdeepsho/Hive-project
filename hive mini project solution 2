-- hi sir the actuall file is almost 2 gb so my cloudera is not able to process the data so i took few records fro the assignment as shashank sir said you dont need to take all THEN
-- the data for this
creating a local table first using csv file 
--first creating  a temp table

Part-I: Examine the data



--1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select   year(Issue_Date) as `year`,  count( Summons_Number) Tickets  from Parking_violation_issued group by year(Issue_Date);


--2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.

select count(distinct Registration_State) as No_of_States from Parking_violation_issued;



--3.) Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
select count( summons_number) as no_of_ticket from Parking_violation_issued  where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;



Part-II: Aggregation tasks

--1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
select count(Violation_Code) as No_of_violation,Violation_Code from Parking_violation_issued group by Violation_Code order by No_of_violation desc limit 5;

--2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as No_of_ticket from Parking_violation_issued 
group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by No_of_ticket desc limit 5;

select Vehicle_Make,count(summons_number)as No_of_ticket from Parking_violation_issued 
group by Vehicle_Make order by No_of_ticket desc limit 5; 



--3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
    --  a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
	  select Violation_Precinct,count(1) as Total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued group by  Violation_Precinct order by Total_ticket desc limit 5;
	
     --b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
	 select Issuer_Precinct,count(1) as Total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued group by Issuer_Precinct order by Total_ticket desc limit 5;
	 
--4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets 
--- do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(1) as Total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued
  group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by Total_ticket desc limit 5;
  
  --hey i am using the part of the data so below code will will work
  select Violation_Code, count(1) as Total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued 
  where Issuer_Precinct= " input prenict" group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
  
  

--5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. 
--Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(regexp_extract(violation_time,'(.*)[A-Z]',1),'HHmm'),"HH:mm") as Tiem_stamp from Parking_violation_issued limit 10;

--6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. 
--For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations

create view park_viol_part_view partitioned on (Violation_Code) as
select Summons_Number, Violation_Time, Issuer_Precinct,
case
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','12') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 1
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 2

and substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','04','05','06','07', '08','09','10','11','12'));

--group 1--
select Violation_Code,count(*) total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued where Violation_binning == 1 group by Violation_Code order by total_ticket desc limit 3;
--group 2--
select Violation_Code,count(*) total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued where Violation_binning == 2 group by Violation_Code order by total_ticket desc limit 3;

--group 6--
select Violation_Code,count(*) total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued where Violation_binning == 6 group by Violation_Code order by total_ticket desc limit 3;


--7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
select Violation_binning, count(*) total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued where Violation_Code in (21,36,37,38) 
group by Violation_binning order by total_ticket desc limit 3;
--8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
      --a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google
	  --search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); 
	  --Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
	  
	  create view tickets_issued_view as
select Violation_Code , Issuer_Precinct,
case
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 03 and 05 then 'spring'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 06 and 08 then 'summer'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 09 and 11 then 'autumn'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) in (1,2,12) then 'winter'
else 'unknown' end  as season 
from Parking_violation_issued;
	  
	  
      --b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.
	  -- by this code we can find out the result as i am using part of the data so mine result will not come accurate
	  
	  select Violation_Code, count(*) as total_ticket from Parking_violation_issued where season = ' ' 
	  group by Violation_Code order by total_ticket desc limit 3;
